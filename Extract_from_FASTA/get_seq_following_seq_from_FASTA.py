# get_seq_following_seq_from_FASTA.py by 
# Wayne Decatur
# ver 0.1
#
#*******************************************************************************
# Verified compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6; written initially in 
# Python 3. 
#
#
# PURPOSE: Takes a sequence pattern string, a sequence file (FASTA-format), & a 
# record id, and extracts a sequence of specified size following the sequence 
# pattern. (The FASTA-formatted sequence file is assumed by default to be a 
# multi-FASTA, i.e., multiple sequences in the provided file, although it 
# definitely doesn't have to be. In case it is only a single sequence, the
# record id becomes moot, see below.) 
# A sequence string of the specified length will be returned. Redirect the 
# output to a file if using command line version and a file is needed.
#
# The provided sequence pattern will be matched regardless of case, as both the
# input sequence and pattern to search will be converted behind-the-scenes to 
# lowercase for the comparison. Beyond being insensitive of the case, REGULAR 
# EXPRESSION SEARCH TERM SYNTAX IS ACCEPTABLE in the provided sequence pattern.
#
# Note that if there is only one record in the specified sequence file, the 
# record id is moot and you can instead provide any string for that parameter 
# as it will be ignored. This makes the script more flexible in cases where 
# sequence files aren't complex as the user doesn't need to provide an actual 
# record id.
# 
# This script is meant to be used after you have performed a large alignment, 
# say of an entire chromosome, in order to have individual occurrences of 
# related segments fall linearly with where they match up along the span of the 
# sequence. Often due to large (seeming-to-be) arbitratrily-sized blocks of 
# repeated unknown nucleotides (which are often good to 'collapse', see 
# `collapse_large_unknown_blocks_in_DNA_sequence.py`) the 'ends' of regions 
# often fail to get extracted exactly right. This script is meant to help in 
# determining how best to clean up such instances. For example, in the obtained
# sequence, is there an 'end' that matches up better with the pattern of known
# 'ends' and should be added?
#
# It is designed to handle/filter gaps ('dashes') in the provided sequence 
# patterns. The idea being that the known sequence ends may be manually 
# extracted from sequence alignments. This way the user is not wasting time 
# removing the gap indications / dashes from the collected text lines. The 
# default handling of removing the gaps to ignore them can be overriden. 
# The idea is that maybe you'll have a multiple sequence alignment 
# file saved as FASTA with dashes, i.e., aligned FASTA file format and may want 
# to use this script.  (The caveat is that number of residues to get will then 
# be counting the gaps / dashes too.)
#
#
#
#
#
# 
#
# Written to run from command line or imported into/pasted/loaded inside a 
# Jupyter notebook cell.

# `Gathering XXXXXXX from aligned XXXXXXXXX genomes collected from the XXXXX genomes project.ipynb` 
# for impetus behind this script.

#
# VERSION HISTORY:
# v.0.1. basic working version. 
#
# To do:
#
#
#
#
# TO RUN:
# Examples,
# Enter on the command line of your terminal, the line
#-----------------------------------
# python get_seq_following_seq_from_FASTA.py seq.fa record_id pattern amount_to_get > extracted_seq.fa
#-----------------------------------
#
# Issue `get_seq_following_seq_from_FASTA.py -h` for details.
# 
#
#
# To use this after importing/pasting or loading into a cell in a Jupyter 
# notebook, call the main function similar to below:
# following_seq = get_seq_following_seq_from_FASTA("seq.fa", "Skluv", "GAAATTTCCCCCAAAATGT" , 200)
# -or-
# when calling the main function you can include `filter_dashes = False` to 
# not remove the dashes from the supplied pattern sequence before comparing.
# This is the equivalent to using `--leave_dashes` option when calling the 
# script from the command line.
#
# 
#

CURRENT ACTUAL CODE FOR RUNNING/TESTING IN A NOTEBOOK WHEN IMPORTED/LOADED OR 
PASTED IN ANOTHER CELL:
