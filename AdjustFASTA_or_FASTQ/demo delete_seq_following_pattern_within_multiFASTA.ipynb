    "The default behaviour of the script is to remove gaps represented by dashes from any sequence pattern provided. The idea is that many use cases will involve searhcing for sequence patterns that have gaps because the sequence text was copied from a sequence alignment, and it seems like a waste of processing to have the user clean the sequences ahead of time. Plus, most people will be searching sequences that don't have gaps.\n",

    "However, with the addition of the `--leave_dashes` option in the command line tool or setting the `filter_dashes` variable to `False` when calling the main function, the user can ovveride this typical behavior and still use the script. For example, with an aligned FASTA file format. The caveat is that number of residues to get will then be counting the gaps / dashes too.\n",
