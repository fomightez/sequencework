# reverse_complement_of_clustal_alignment.py by 
# Wayne Decatur
# ver 0.1
#
#*******************************************************************************
# Verified compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6; written initially in 
# Python 3. 
#
#
# PURPOSE: Takes a text document of an alignment in CLUSTAL format and generates
# that same alignment but with composing sequences as reverse complements.
# MEANT FOR DNA WHERE REVERSE COMPLEMENT IS BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT.
# 
# Intended to be used after `extract_regions_from_clustal_alignment.py` for 
# sequences on the other (a.k.a. reverse) strand because some might be on other 
# strand when extract from entire chromosome and sometimes still it would make 
# more sense to view the extracted sequence in the other direction. For 
# example, if typically used to looking at the regions in one direction, or that
# make 'biological sense', etc.
# 
# Because alignment files contain no 'description' information, the script has 
# an option to provide the file of the ungapped, FASTA-formatted sequences 
# that are output as `*_extracted_ungapped.fa` files from the 
# `extract_regions_from_clustal_alignment.py` in order
# to have the description lines added to the ungpapped, reverse complement FASTA
# -formatted sequences this script includes as output.
#
#
# 
#
# Written to run from command line or imported into/pasted/loaded inside a 
# Jupyter notebook cell. When doing in Jupyter (IPython, I believe) you can skip
# the file save intermediate, see https://git.io/vh8Mi for similar advanced 
# examples.

# VERSION HISTORY:
# v.0.1. basic working version

#
# To do:
# - any way to make it work with a string?
#
#
#
#
# TO RUN:
# Examples,
# Enter on the command line of your terminal, the line
#-----------------------------------
# python reverse_complement_of_clustal_alignment.py ALIGNMENT_TEXT_FILE
#-----------------------------------
#
# Issue `reverse_complement_of_clustal_alignment.py -h` for details.
# 
#
#
# To use this after importing/pasting or loading into a cell in a Jupyter 
# notebook, specify at least the results file (or results as a string) in the 
# call to the main function similar to below:
# reverse_complement_of_clustal_alignment("test.clustal")
# 
#-or-
# To specify OPTIONAL source of description line for the description lines made
# by this script you can use 'descr_source' to indicate the file of ungapped 
# extracted FASTA-formatted seqeuence outout by 
# `extract_regions_from_clustal_alignment.py` similar to below:
# reverse_complement_of_clustal_alignment("test.clustal",descr_source="BlockA_extracted_ungapped.fa")

def get_aln_index_and_real_pos(sequence):
    '''
    a generator that takes a sequence and then returns next position in 
    alignment (equivalent to index, i.e., zero-indexed) and the actual position 
    in the contiguous sequence to which that corresponds. So the second-value
    is the ungapped position in common terms.
    For example, if sequence is `a-b`,the first values returned are `0,1`.
    The second values returned are `1,1`. And third returned values are `2,2`.
