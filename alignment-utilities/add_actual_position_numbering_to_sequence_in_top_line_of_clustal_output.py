# add_actual_position_numbering_to_sequence_in_top_line_of_clustal_output.py by 
# Wayne Decatur
# ver 0.1
#
#*******************************************************************************
# Verified compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6; written initially in 
# Python 3. 
#
#
# PURPOSE: Takes a text document of an alignment in CLUSTAL format and adds 
# position indicators to the top line that is the actual numbering of the 
# residues in the contiguous sequence. The added annotation makes it easier to 
# locate regions in the alignment if you know the location in the top sequence, 
# typically the reference sequence. Assumes the top line begins at residue one.
#
# Mview program at EMBL-EBI https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mview/ will take
# a clustal formatted alignment and add numbers, but they will be the total 
# numbers of characters on the the line, including the dashes that indicate gaps
# and so they will simply count up 80 at a time. For locating residues relative
# the numbering in the contiguous sequence, it isn't very helpful for when there
# are large gaps, such as when aligning an entire chromosome of divergent 
# organisms.
# RELATED:
# Clustal Omega program at EMBL-EBI  https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/
# generates alignment with character counting for each sequence in alignment if
# default `ClustalW with character counts` accepted. An additional note is that
# if you want to keep your reference sequence on the top, open `More options...` 
# and change to `ORDER` setting > `input` to keep the sequences in the alignment
# in the order if the input, instead of allowing the program to alter the order.
# PLUS, http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/group_dna.html will add numbers to
# FASTA format and FAST format can include gaps.

# VERSION HISTORY:
# v.0.1. basic working version

#
# To do:
# - update so that it handles if the top line doesn't begin with residue number 
# one. Do that similar to the approach used in 
# `MSA_to_corresponding_residue_numbers.py` so that a number can be supplied 
# that is the actual numbering of the first residue.
#

# TO RUN:

# Enter on the command line of your terminal, the line

    '''
    Main function of script. 
    It will take an alignment text file (or the alignment as a Python string) 
    and add position indicators to the top line that is the actual numbering of 
    the residues in contiguous sequence.

    The option to provide the results as a string is to handle where sending the
    data directly from shell script to Python without a typical file 
    intermediate, see the advanced notebook at https://git.io/vpr7i for 
    examples. The obvious use case for that is when working in the Jupyter 
    # notebook environment.

    except (TypeError,OSError,IOError) as e:
        pass # pass because instead just want to use results as a string because
        # probably provided as a string directly piped from PatMatch to Python
        # without file intermediate. The results variable will already be a
        # string in that case and so ready to go and don't need to read file.
        # The `except` above the pass has three errors it excepts because the
        # first was a TypeError seen when I tried to pass a file-like string to
        # `with open` because it seems `with open` method is incompatible with
        # use of StringIO, I think, which I usually use to try to pass things 
        # associated with file methods string. (I qualifed it with 'I think' b/c 
        # questions on stackoverlflow seemed to agree but I didn't try every 
        # possibility because realized this would probably be a better way to 
        # handle anyway.) That TypeError except got me to the next issue which
        # was trying the string as a file name and getting it was too long, and 
        # so I added the `OSError` catch and that seemed to make passing a 
        # string into the function work. `IOError` seemed to handle that same
        # thing in Python 2.7.
