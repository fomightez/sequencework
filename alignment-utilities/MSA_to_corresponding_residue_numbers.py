#*******************************************************************************
# Verified compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6; written initially in 
# Python 3. 
#
#
# PURPOSE: Takes a multiple sequence alignment in Clustal format and determines
# the corresponding residue numbers for aligned residues for a specified 
# reference sequence in the alignment and the pairing of it with every other 
# aligned sequence. The reference sequence is specified by the identifier at 
# the start of each line in the sequence blocks.
# The sequences provided do not have to begin at reside one, but in that
# case the starting position represented for each sequence in the alignment must
# be provided. Even if all the others are simply `1`. The ends don't have to 
# represent full sequences either, and in that case nothing needs to be done if 
# they are truncated. They just won't be addressed. For the numberings extracted 
# to be correct, the only requirements is that the sequence between the first 
# and last residue be contiguous discounting gaps. The gaps don't matter but the
# sequence has to be intact once it starts are the specified residue number, 
# default of which is one. In other words, once the chain starts, no internal 
# stretches of residues or even a single residue can be absent. This can be 
# verified by using my script `check_seq_frag_in_MSAclustal_intact_viaFASTA.py`
# to compare a sequence in a multiple sequence alignment to that in a FASTA and
# validate it contains a continuous fragment. Optionally, 
# `check_seq_frag_in_MSAclustal_intact_viaFASTA.py` can return the value that
# corresponds to the first position of the fragment represented in the multiple
# sequence alignment, and so the information it yeilds can be very useful when 
# writing commands to call the script or main function when using fragments of 
# sequences in the multiple sequence alignment.
#
# Meant to be used to determine the specific corresponding pairs of residues of
# sequences represented in the alignment relative the sequence of a chain 
# available in a structure model. With these pairs of residues macromolecular 
# visualization commands, such as those that fit/dock/compare or highlight 
# corresponding residues via distinguishing colors and representations, can be 
# written. (For the latter, you may wish to also see 
# `categorize_residues_based_on_conservation_relative_consensus_line.py` as a 
# related & distinct alternative.)
# There a notebook demonstrating of use of this script to automagically write
# fit/dock/compare commands available via 
# https://github.com/fomightez/cl_demo-binder
# Note that all numbers returned by the script will be in common terms where
# the fist residue in a sequence is numbered ONE. (In other words, the 
# zero-indexing behind-the-scenes will not be visible to user.)

def MSA_to_corresponding_residue_numbers(
    alignment, ref_id, supplied_start_pos = None, return_dfs = False):
    '''
    Main function of script. 
    It will take an alignment text file (CLUSTAL form) determine the determines
    the corresponding residue numbers for aligned residues for a specified 
    reference sequence in the alignment and the pairing of it with every other 
    aligned sequence. The reference sequence is specified by `ref_id`.
    Presumably the reference sequence is one that has been solved structurally 
    and you want to know the exact residues that match so you can use the 
    backbone (a.k.a., 'spine') of the chain as a guide to fit or highlight or 
    otherwise process the other chains in the alignment in some manner.

    The default is to assume that all sequences in the multiple sequence 
    alignmentbeing with residue number one. `supplied_start_pos` allows for a 
    list to be supplied with the first position for each sequence if at least 
    one differs from starting at 1. The list must be the same length as the 
    number of sequences in the multiple sequence alignment and so supply `1` for
    each of those that begin at the first residue.

    While the sequences don't need to start at residue number one if 
    `supplied_start_pos` is used, they do need to be consecutive once they 
    start in order for numbers extracted to make any sense. In other words,
    no residues can be skipped internally. You can use my script 
    `check_seq_frag_in_MSAclustal_intact_viaFASTA.py` to aid in validating this.

    Sequences at the end of the sequence need not be present in the multiple
    sequence alignment; howerver, if that is the case, no equivalent residues
    can be supplied for the missing end. This may be reasonable if that part is 
    of no concern for downstream applications.

    Note that all numbers returned by the script will be in common terms where
    the fist residue in a sequence is numbered ONE. (In other words, the 
    zero-indexing behind-the-scenes will not be visible to user.)

    If `return_dfs` is supplied as `True`, it will return the `ref_id` and a
    dictionary of the dataframes of the matched residue blocks (start and end 
    for each). This is meant to be used when calling from a Jupyter notebook or 
    IPython.
    The script saves a tab-separated file of the matched residue blocks for each 
    reference sequence-query pairing.

    # in the notebook entitled 
    # 'Using Biopython's PDB module to list resolved residues and construct fit commands.ipynb' 
    # in 'cl_demo-binder' @ github is that here I cannot just make one list and 
    # package consecutive residues. It has to be done without respect to both 
    # sequences so any condensed ranges (intervals) match up. For example, if 
    # there is a gap between say the 
    # query sequence while the say reference sequence is contiguous and I make 
    # a range using it, they won't come out with matching numbers of ranges. The 
    # reference sequence will be represented as one range and the query sequence 
    # will be represented as two and you cannot make a fit command with 
    # unequal numbers of backbone atoms.
    # I think the solution is to make multiple lists for each sequence using 
    # the other sequence to guide where the lists should end and then 
    # process all those separate into ranges and then stitch them together for 
    # the appropriate chain at the end. So that they match up with equal numbers 
    # of backbone atoms represented.

    # To start, go through for each id nd put the reference and query residues 
    # in lists, with one match set in each list. Lists divide into new lists 
    # at each non-consecutive break in either chain. List of lists for 
    # reference chain is first in tuple and reference is second.
