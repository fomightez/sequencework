    plot_5prime_end_from_bedgraph.py plots data from bedgraph files for a
    particular region. **** Script by Wayne Decatur (fomightez @ github) ***

    positional arguments:
      start-end             Region to plot indicated by start postion followed by
                            a dash, and then the end position. Example, `200-500`.
                            REQUIRED.
      FORWARD_DATA          Name of file containing the forward data in bedgraph
                            format. REQUIRED.
      REVERSE_DATA          Name of file containing the reverse data in bedgraph
                            format. REQUIRED.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -revo, --reverse_orientation
                            Plot left to right to correspond to 5'-> 3' direction
                            on reverse strand.
      -ctp CUSTOM_TITLE_PREFIX, --custom_title_prefix CUSTOM_TITLE_PREFIX
                            Provide a string after this flag to use that text as
                            the start of the plot title. Typically, the region
                            info is used to form the tile of the plot image to be
                            saved; however, if this is provided it will be instead
                            used as part of the file name.
      -si SAMPLE_ID, --sample_id SAMPLE_ID
                            Provide a string after this flag to use that text as
                            the sample id/strain name to be in parentheses at end
                            of the plot title. If provided, it will also be
                            incorporated into name of saved plot.
      -svg, --svg           Also save as a vector graphics file (SVG) useful for
                            working in subsequent graphics editing.
      -lim INT, --limit INT
                            **FOR ADVANCED USE.*** Allows for controlling the
                            upper end of scale for y-axis. Should only be needed
                            when extremes of values in one plot might not match a
                            plot for a related but different sample. Put the upper
                            limit integer after the flag, such as `--limit 82`.
      -spa, --single_peak_annotation
                            Only show annotation of the maximum peak for both
                            forward and reverse strand data.
      -npa, --no_peak_annotation
                            Turn off annotation of the peak points of 5'-ends for
                            both forward and reverse data.
      -nda, --no_dist_annotation
                            Turn off annotation of the distance between peak
                            points of forward and reverse data.
      -ls, --large_size     Print large image of plot.
      -exp_d, --export_data
                            Export the data as CSV printed to the console as
                            stdout; use a redirect in a shell command to send the
                            output to a file. If the `--reverse_orientation`
                            option is utilized when the script is called then the
                            data is exported as of the complementary strand 5'-end
                            is the starting point. This is a utility feature added
                            to enable easily passing the data mined by this script
                            onto related scripts. This overrides the plotting
                            action, i.e, in this mode no plot will be made,
                            despite the name of the script.

**IMPORTANTLY: There is a notebook demonstrating use of this script and illustrating many of the options [available here](https://github.com/fomightez/clausen_ribonucleotides).**

Verified compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.6.

Written to run from command line or pasted/loaded inside a Jupyter notebook cell.  
The main ways to run the script are demonstrated in [a series of notebooks illustrating using PatMatch with Python](https://github.com/fomightez/patmatch-binder).

Example calls to run script from command line:
```
python plot_5prime_end_from_bedgraph.py 5013-5359 forward.bedgraph reverse.bedgraph

python plot_5prime_end_from_bedgraph.py 5013-5359 forward.bedgraph reverse.bedgraph --sample_id WT3b

python plot_5prime_end_from_bedgraph.py 5013-5359 forward.bedgraph reverse.bedgraph --sample_id WT3b --reverse_orientation
```

(Alternatively, upload the script to a Jupyter environment and use `%run plot_5prime_end_from_bedgraph.py 5013-5359 forward.bedgraph reverse.bedgraph` in a Python-backed notebook to run the example.)

The impetus for writing it was to plot ribonucleotide incorporation data from [Clausen et al., 2015 (PMID:25622295)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25622295); however, it is more general than that as it can plot any 5'-end data in bedgraph files. As of the time of writing this though part of the title text and other things reflecting that intention is hard coded inside the script, and so you should look at some of the variables under 'USER ADJUSTABLE VALUES ' and edit the text to reflect your data if you use it for something else.

* plot_coverage.py (NEED TO PUT IN THIS REPO STILL)
> high-throughput sequencing data --> plot of coverage for specified region (or expoerted relative data)

Takes data previously generated by the use of [Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html) with sorted and indexed BAM files for high-throughput sequencing data (intended for Illumina-generated data) and makes a plot of the coverage for the specified region. It can also be used to pass data from that source to other computational tools. 

* plot_coverage_and_starts.pyy (NEED TO PUT IN THIS REPO STILL)
> high-throughput sequencing data --> plot of coverage and 5'-ends for specified region (or expoerted relative data)

Takes data previously generated by the use of [Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html) with sorted and indexed BAM files for high-throughput sequencing data (intended for Illumina-generated data) and makes a plot of the coverage and 5'-ends for the specified region. It can also be used to pass data from that source to other computational tools. 

**Note for plot_coverage.py and plot_coverage_and_starts.py  I intend to put here-->** These need data previously generated by the use of [Samtools](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html) with sorted and indexed BAM files for sequencing data.  
**Another Note for the  plot_coverage.py and plot_coverage_and_starts.py  I intend to put here first -->** Despite the names, they both have `--export_data` options that can be called to easily pass the data they mine from the input data, but **WHEN THIS OPTION IS USED NO PLOT IS MADE**. It is meant to be used in conjunction with plots probably already made and with other scripts, see the section `Related items created by myself` below. It was a deliberate choice to add directly to the script the ability to export the data rather than duplicating the data processing steps in a separate script with the idea it would lessen the need for propagating changes to multiple places to keep such related scripts in sync.

Related items created by myself
-------------------------------

I have made a script that utilizes the `--export_data` option to run `plot_coverage_and_starts.py` to automate an effort:
* [`shepherds_read_starts_at_start_of_origins_thru_to_plotting.py`](https://github.com/fomightez/mini-pipelines)

Specifically, the script [`shepherds_read_starts_at_start_of_origins_thru_to_plotting.py`](https://github.com/fomightez/mini-pipelines) utilizes the `--export_data` option to run `plot_coverage_and_starts.py` in an automated manner and plot the starts in a subregion of the data using the script `plot_stacked_bar_plots_with_fit.py`. The associated script `plot_stacked_bar_plots_with_fit.py` is found [here](https://github.com/fomightez/general_scripted_plotting), as it is general and not specific to read data.
