# Annotation utilities

Scripts
-----------

- `measure_intergenic_regions_in_mito_annotations.py`

>annotation file and corresponding sequence file for a fungal mitochondrial genome > list of intergenic gap sizes

There is a [demo notebook for this script in this repo](https://github.com/fomightez/cl_sq_demo-binder). Launch a binder session from there and select 'Demo of script to get intergenic gap sizes from annotation file' to run it actively.  The particular notebook can be viewed statically, nicely displayed [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fomightez/cl_sq_demo-binder/blob/master/notebooks/Demo%20of%20script%20to%20get%20intergenic%20gap%20sizes%20from%20annotation%20file.ipynb).

The contents of [the Adjust_Annotation section here](https://github.com/fomightez/sequencework/tree/master/Adjust_Annotation) would probably be best put under this topic but predates this sub-directory. Currently it houses two scripts and points at some other resources:
* fix_lsu_rRNA_annotation_in_gff_resulting_from_mfannot.py
* makes_length_annotation_file.py
