The contents of [the Adjust_Annotation section here](https://github.com/fomightez/sequencework/tree/master/Adjust_Annotation) would probably be best put under this topic but predates this sub-directory. Currently it houses two scripts and points at some other resources:
* fix_lsu_rRNA_annotation_in_gff_resulting_from_mfannot.py
* makes_length_annotation_file.py
