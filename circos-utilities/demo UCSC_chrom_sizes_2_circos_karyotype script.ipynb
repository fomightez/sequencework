You could always launch that environment and upload this notebook there and things should work.)\n",

    "(For the sake of this demonstration, I am going to use `curl` to get the file from github and upload it to the 'local' environment. You of course can use whatever download and upload steps you'd like, such as using a browser and your system's graphical user interface, to place the script in the directory. 'local' is in parentheses because if running this in a Jupyter interface via the Binder system, 'local' would be inside the running enviroment.)"
