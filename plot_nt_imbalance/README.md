Scripts for plotting nucleotide imbalance from DNA sequences
============================================================

# The scripts

* nucleotide_difference_imbalance_plot_stylized_like_Figure_8_of_Morrill_et_al_2016.py
> FASTA sequence for a region of a chromosome/contig/scaffold --> plot of GvsC and AvsT imbalance

See [[Figure 8, panel B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4882425/figure/F8/) of [Morrill et al 2016(PMID: 27026700)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27026700).

There is a demonstration of this script available in my set of sequence analysis related demonstrations notebooks [here](https://github.com/fomightez/cl_sq_demo-binder). To run it actively,  launch a binder session by clicking on the `launch binder` badges there and select 'Demo of script to XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' to run it actively.  The particular notebook can be viewed statically, nicely displayed [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fomightez/cl_sq_demo-binder/blob/master/notebooks/Demo%2XXXXXXXX.ipynb).
